                June Ho is majoring in Computer Science and is from Orange County, California. Although he didn't compete in Science Olympiad in high school, he did compete in Chemistry Olympiad (earned top 152 honors on the 2016 USNCO) and enjoyed supervising one of the events at last year's invitational. He is excited to serve as co-director this year! Outside of schoolwork and Science Olympiad, June enjoys painting, photography, and video games.

                Jonathan is from Solon, Ohio and in the MOL department. After 6 years in middle and high school Science Olympiad, he's excited to give others the chance to push the limits of how small their font size can get or how many times they can superglue their fingers together. Outside of PUSO, he is a part of Finding the Match, Manna, and Six14 Dance Company, but his real passion is eating. Sometimes forgetting he's a student, his day mostly goes from one nap to the next.
