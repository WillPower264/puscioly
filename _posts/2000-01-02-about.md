Princeton University hosted its first ever **Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament** on February 4, 2017. Founded by Edison Lee '19 and David Fan '19, Science Olympiad at Princeton aspires to translate its collective SciOly experience into providing new and veteran teams alike from across the nation with a high-quality invitational experience. Stay tuned for more information on next year's tournament! 

The competition is organized and run entirely by undergraduates at Princeton University, many of whom were national and state medalists in Science Olympiad. Coaches are thus **not** responsible for running any competition events -- we hope that this will give coaches time to prepare as well as time to supervise their teams on competition day. This invitational intends to provide teams with strong preparation for their respective regional and state tournaments, as well as the national tournament.

All 23 Division C events will be run and unless otherwise stated, following the national event rules. All exams will be written by Science Olympiad alumni and the competition schedule closely resembles that of Nationals. In addition to competing in events, students will have the opportunity to learn about Princeton's STEM offerings, tour campus and more! Results at this invitational will not affect teams' bids for state and/or national qualification.
