**Director: David Fan** '19

SciOly occupied every waking hour of David's time from middle school to high school, and he hopes that other people will be able to grow as much from their SciOly experiences as much as he did. In his senior year of high school, David served as tournament director for New Jersey's first-ever Science Olympiad invitational tournament, held at Montgomery High School. Last year, David and Eddie supervised the "Green Generation" event at MIT's 2016 Science Olympiad Invitational. David hopes to translate his seven-plus years of experience with Science Olympiad into creating an amazing invitational experience for everyone.

**Director: Edison (Eddie) Lee** '19

Eddie is a sophomore currently majoring in Chemical and Biological Engineering (note: currently). He competed at Nats for two years with Community Middle School, and then with West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North, leading HSN's team to nationals for the first time in seven years (Woo Nebraska!). While not obsessed with Science Olympiad, Eddie enjoys thinking about Science Olympiad, Science Olympiad, and the meaning of life.

**Logistics Committee: Cathy Chen** '18

Cathy is a junior studying computer science. She really liked physics in high school, and misses it a lot, so she's excited to help organize Science Olympiad. She also likes running, playing violin, and listening to covers on YouTube. One of these days, she hopes to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube.

**Logistics Committee: Sanna Lee** '20  
Sanna hailed from Brooklyn, NY before her family recently moved to New York City's least favorite child-- Staten Island. Refrain from asking Sanna about her current freshman year's schedule, but do ask her about her high school SciOly experience, her cat Moomoo, and her mango allergy.

**Bill (Yan) Huang** '19

Bill is a sophomore math major (math is too hard) from West-Windsor Plainsboro South. As someone who enjoyed math and science competitions in high school (when math was less hard), he is eager to make SciOly a fun event for everyone. Aside from lots of combinatorics, he likes swimming, playing piano, trolling, playing unhealthy amounts of video games and anime. Especially anime. Need we say more?
