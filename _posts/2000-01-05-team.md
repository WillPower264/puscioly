**Director: David Fan** '19

SciOly occupied every waking hour of David's time from middle school to high school, and he hopes that other people will be able to grow as much from their SciOly experiences as much as he did. In his senior year of high school, David served as tournament director for New Jersey's first-ever Science Olympiad invitational tournament, held at Montgomery High School. Last year, David and Eddie supervised the "Green Generation" event at MIT's 2016 Science Olympiad Invitational. David hopes to translate his seven-plus years of experience with Science Olympiad into creating an amazing invitational experience for everyone.

**Logistics Committee: Sanna Lee** '20  
Sanna hailed from Brooklyn, NY before her family recently moved to New York City's least favorite child-- Staten Island. Refrain from asking Sanna about her current freshman year's schedule, but do ask her about her high school SciOly experience, her cat Moomoo, and her mango allergy.
