June-Ho and Linus oversee all aspects of the invitational as tournament directors			
June-Ho Park	20	Director	June Ho is a sophomore from Orange County, California who is likely going to be a BSE ORFE major. Although he didn't compete in Science Olympiad in high school, he did compete in Chemistry Olympiad (earned top 152 honors on the 2016 USNCO) and enjoyed supervising one of the events at last year's invitational. He is excited to serve as the co-director of Finance and treasurer this year! Outside of schoolwork and Science Olympiad, June enjoys painting, photography, and video games.
Linus Wang	21	Director	Linus is a freshman from Palo Alto, California who is planning on majoring in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Linus has participated in Science Olympiad for two years where his favorite events are ID events or anything with a binder. In his spare time, Linus likes playing pool, super smash bros, and practicing the French horn. He is looking forward to being a part of the team and hopes to help run an awesome tournament this year!
