<p>Princeton University will be hosting its first ever <strong>Science Olympiad Invitational Tournament</strong> on February 4, 2017. Founded by Edison Lee ‘19 and David Fan ‘19, Science Olympiad at Princeton aims to translate its collective SciOly experience into providing new and veteran teams alike from across the nation with a high-quality invitational experience. The competition is organized and run entirely organized by undergraduates at Princeton University, many of whom are past national and state medalists in Science Olympiad. We hope that this invitational will provide teams with strong preparation for their respective regional and state tournaments, as well as the national tournament.</p>

<p>The invitational will run all 23 Division C events and unless otherwise stated, will be following the national event rules. All exams will be written by Science Olympiad alumni and the competition schedule (to be released soon) will closely resemble that of Nationals. In addition to competing in events, students will have the opportunity to learn about Princeton’s STEM offerings, tour campus and more! Results at this invitational will not affect teams’ bids for state and/or national qualification.</p>
