                  In high school, Shirley competed with the Fayetteville-Manlius Science Olympiad team, with whom she has fond memories of 1 AM build testing, 10 person human pyramids, and smashing whipped cream in peoples' faces.
                  When not directing Science Olympiad, you can find Shirley making bubble tea runs and nursing her perpetually sprained ankles.

In 2016, he was one of the 20 USNCO study campers. Besides Science Olympiad, he enjoys playing piano, thinking of puns, and synthesizing colorful compounds. Last year, he supervised the Forensics event at the 2016 Princeton University Invitational. This year, he's excited to help make Princeton Science Olympiad an amazing experience for all!

                  Bill is currently a junior majoring in Mathematics, but knows a surprising amount of Earth Science. He is still salty (and probably will always be) about choking Experimental Design at states, but still has plenty of fond memories (and lots of medals) from his years of Science Olympiad with West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. If he's running your event, chances are the test will be rather difficult, so be prepared :) In his free time, he enjoys swimming (which comes with great pregames) and playing piano, but usually ends up wasting all of it on Steam. Last year, Bill was the event supervisor for Astronomy.

Prior to Princeton, Seth participated heavily in Science Olympiad and led his team as the head of builds and events. Science Olympiad was a wonderful experience for him, and as such he looks forward to giving back to the community by helping run Princeton's Science Olympiad Invitational this year! Some of Seth's other interests on campus include Ballroom dancing and Taiko drumming, and one can often find him practicing these on a typical day. Outside of school, Seth like to go hiking in National Parks, play chess both casually and competitively, and read books, novels, and plays.

After 6 years in middle and high school Science Olympiad, he is excited to be help other people learn (suffer) instead of suffering himself (although he will miss his graveyard of bales builds). Outside of PUSO, he enjoys rock climbing, takes part in Manna and Six14, and occasionally practices piano in random classrooms. His motivation to get from one day to the next is always food (down for KBBQ anytime).

Last year, Reilly served as the Head Event Supervisor for Chemistry Lab, and he is really looking forward to serving as the Logistics Director for next year's competition! Although he has no idea what he wants to do with his life, Reilly's passion for computer science has driven him to pursue a BSE COS degree, which he supplements with studies related to his other passions such as music, physics, and Latin. Outside of class, Reilly loves watching movies, eating good food (especially sushi), and — above all else — playing percussion in the fantastic Princeton University Orchestra!

                  Hoi is a freshman from Brooklyn, New York, but has also lived in Hong Kong for ten years. She is a prospective chemistry major and is obsessed with conducting experiments in the kitchen (a.k.a. cooking). She competed with the Stuyvesant High School Science Olympiad team for two years and absolutely loved the experience. She is enthusiastic about working with the talented board and meeting fellow science lovers during the upcoming Invitational! If not in class, Hoi is most commonly found chasing squirrels on the lawns, wandering around Wilcox, and struggling to run up the Washington Road slope.

In her free time, Audrey enjoys playing piano and clarinet, occasionally composing music or drawing, and questioning her major choice.
